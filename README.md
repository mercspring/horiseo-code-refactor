# horiseon-code-refactor
Refactored the code for the Horiseon home page for two reasons: to better optimize it for search engines and to improve usabilty for those using screen readers. 

I accomplished this by:

- Adding alt tags to the photos.
- Adding semantic headings to the html
- Adding a meta description tag so that the site would be described in search engine results
- Adding a proper title to the page
- Moving a background image to a regular image tag in order to allow for an atl attribute
- Changing the heading structure

Addionally, I cleaned up the codebase by:

- Scaling images down in size, without hurting quality, so that the page would load faster
- Condesing the css to make it more readable 
- Cleaning up the html
- Fixing a broken link
